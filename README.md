## Preparation for development

### Local Development
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MotocalDevelopers/motocal.git motocal
$ cd motocal
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ open index.html
```
or
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MotocalDevelopers/motocal.git motocal
$ cd motocal
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
$ open localhost:8000
```
### Docker version
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MotocalDevelopers/motocal.git motocal
$ cd motocal
$ docker-compose up
```

## Build command
### Commands for development environment
```sh
$ npm run start
```

### Debug Build
```sh
$ npm run build
```
### Debug Watch
```sh
$ npm run watch-dev
```
### Build for release
```sh
$ npm run production-build
```
### Release Watch
```sh
$ npm run production-watch-dev
```

## Structure
- src: Source code before trans-piling
- dist: Source code after trans-piling
- scripts: Script for generating data
- txt_sources: Text data for template processing
- imgs, charaimgs: Image data for templates display

## Workflow
### Function development
1. Fiddling inside src
2. Generate dist / main.js etc. with npm run build
    - For release builds, run ''npm run production-build''
    - Or monitor with ''npm run watch-dev''
3. Merge the production branch on release and then run ''npm run production-build''

### Updating weapon templates
1. For the weapon you want to add, copy the corresponding line of the wiki and paste it on the top of txt_source/armData-ssr.txt
2. Run arm_data_converter.py
    - When dealing with new skills, please add the corresponding new skill name to arm_data_converter.py => Add the new skill to the calculator.
